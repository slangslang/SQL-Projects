HELLO!
In this repository you'll find my very first MYSQL project. Here's a list of things I've done within this project:

      - Create a Database
      - Create tables within database
      - Input data into the tables
      - Perform practice exercises based on the information within the database tables

& here are the tables I've used to make this project happen

![Reward table](https://github.com/slangslang/SQL-Projects/assets/79164773/c40a62cd-69aa-4aa9-9d75-444b9c970ab4)


Thanks to stackhowto, I was able to touch up on my SQL skills and will definitely be doing a lot more of these in the near future!
